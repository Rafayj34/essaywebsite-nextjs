      <p className="content-p">
        The first paragraph is the most important part of an Expository Essay
        format. It introduces the topic and gives an overview of the main points
        you will make in the essay. A typical introduction has a hook to get the
        reader's attention, some building sentences that explain the topic's
        background, and a thesis statement.

      <p className="content-p">
        Most of the time, there are three body paragraphs in an Expository
        Essay. The topic sentence is followed by sentences that try to explain
        or develop the argument using evidence and logic. The paragraph ends
        with a sentence that wraps up the point made in the paragraph and leads
        into the next paragraph. In the last paragraph of your essay, you
        restate your thesis, and summaries, and give a final thought on the
        topic, which could be an opinion, a solution, or a prediction.

        sometimes need to learn how you feel about a subject or what you want to
        talk about when it comes to that subject. In other words, when you write
        an expository essay, the project's outcome depends greatly on the
        research you do on the topic and how you write. When you're given a task
        involving an expository essay, you're not supposed to prove what you
        already know. Instead, you're supposed to learn while you work!
