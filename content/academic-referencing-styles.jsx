<h1 className="content-h1">Some Important Tips for academic referencing styles</h1>
<p className="content-p">Depending on whether you're citing an author or authors, a textbook or journal article, or an electronic source, the format of each individual reference may differ slightly.</p>
<p className="content-p">Before structuring your source list, take some time to review the precise requirements for each reference type. Here are some pointers on including academic referencing styles in your document.</p>
<ul className="content-list">
    <li className="mb-2">Make a new page to keep track of your references.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Make a new page called "References."
</li>
<li className="mb-2">At the top of the page, center the title text.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Sort all of the entries alphabetically.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">A reference's initial line should be flush with the left margin.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Each additional line should be indented (usually accomplished using the TAB key).</li>
<li className="mb-2">Double-spacing the reference section is a must.</li>
<li className="mb-2">
For book, journal, magazine, and newspaper titles, use italics.</li>
<li className="mb-2">Include all cited sources in the text and on the reference page.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 className="content-h2">Hints and suggestions for referencing</h2>
<ul className="content-list">
    <li className="mb-2">Keep in mind: If you don't already know, ask your tutor which referencing style you should use.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Be upbeat: when references are correctly employed, they boost your writing by indicating that you spent time investigating and digesting data before developing your ideas and arguments.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Be firm in your decisions on referencing your sources and mixing directly quoting, paraphrasing, and summarising (read about these in the introductory primary sections of Cite Them Right Online).
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Be organized: plan ahead of time and keep track of all possible beneficial sources when you come across them.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Prepare yourself by reading the appropriate reference material before beginning your first assignment.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">Be continuous: after you've defined the referencing style, you'll need to stick to it throughout your projects.</li>
<li className="mb-2">Be compassionate: set aside time and take your time to double-check your referencing.</li>
<li className="mb-2">
Be specific about the type of source you're citing, and look up samples at Cite them Right Online.</li>
<li className="mb-2">Write notes: Keep a sheet of paper aside from the start of your essay to jot down references, authors, and quotes whenever you come across something that will be valuable. Even if you don't use the quote or citation, this list will come in handy when you require particular referring information like publishing year, publication location, etc.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">There's nothing more frustrating than remembering a quote but not knowing who said it!</li>
<li className="mb-2">Take a look at the pros: Examine how academics cite sources in scholarly journal papers and the sources you're employing. Because you're already studying their work, it's the most efficient approach to learn how to be consistent with referencing.</li>
<li className="mb-2">Be thorough: Check your work and references before submitting your assignment to ensure that all of your citations correspond to full references and vice versa.</li>
<li className="mb-2">Check twice: Proofreading your essay is a common procedure, but do you double-check your referencing? Checking your academic referencing styles list after a break between creating it and proofreading to ensure you're looking at it fresh will help you avoid submitting work with incorrect full stops or italics.</li>

      <h1 className="content-h1">When to reference
</h1>
<p className="content-p">Referencing sources is sometimes presented as a simple, rule-based procedure. However, there are a lot of grey areas when it comes to reference, and knowing how to follow citation standards requires time and effort. If you're perplexed by it, you're not alone; you might be thinking in the right direction. Here are some pointers to assist you in navigating the world of citations.</p>
<p className="content-p">
When you are directly quoting someone, you must reference them, which is the most straightforward rule to grasp. If you're paraphrasing someone else's words word for word, you must put quotation marks around them and provide credit to the original author. If you don't, you're giving your reader the impression that these words are your own and reflect your own effort.</p>
<p className="content-p">When you're referencing something up for debate, you'll want to use references. For example, suppose you wish to argue that the Patriot Act is a critical instrument for national security. In that case, you should be able to provide examples of how it has aided and how experts have said that it has helped. Many Americans who believe it infringes on their privacy rights will disagree with you, and they will be able to find opinions claiming that the Patriot Act has done more harm than good to the country. You must be ready to demonstrate to skeptics that you have specialists on your side.</p>
<h1 className="content-h1">What do I need to reference?
</h1>
<p className="content-p">Every time you quote or paraphrase someone else's work, you must cite it. This includes direct quotations as well as paraphrases and summaries.
There are several different referencing styles to choose from, which will be discussed on the following page, however, you will almost always be needed to:</p>
<ul className="content-list">
<li className="mb-2">When you're citing a source, make a note of it in the body of the text or a footnote.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">At the end of your paper, include a citation of your sources.
</li>
<li className="mb-2">
You may need to incorporate information on websites, papers, and visual content such as films or images in your references and books and journal articles.</li>

</ul>
