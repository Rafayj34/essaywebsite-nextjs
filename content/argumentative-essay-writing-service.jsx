        of view. The learner must decide whether to argue for or against a
        motion with good points and reasons. They have to show what they believe
        and back up what they say with good sources.

        How to write an argumentative essay structure in steps
      </h2>
      <p className="content-p">
        If your teacher has given you the freedom to do so, the first step is to
        choose your topic. The topic should be important and up-to-date in the
        society being studied. Such issues have yet to be talked about too much.
        The case should be something you can debate, which means that people can
        look at it from different points of view.
      </p>
      <p className="content-p">
        Topics that are good for research are ones where a writer can find a lot
        of up-to-date, reliable sources of information. Lastly, topics that are
        easy to handle let the writer cover them in the number of pages or words
        they are given.
      </p>
      <p className="content-p">
        The main or main points that support your point of view should be the
        basis for the outline. It should also have one or two claims
        contradicting yours and show that you are wrong.
      </p>
      <p className="content-p">
        It's important to remember that below each main point, you should list
        at least two secondary facts that back up your main points. When
        outlining, it's important always to choose a pattern that makes the most
        sense and seems convincing to the reader.
      </p>
      <p className="content-p">
        Next, start writing the rough draught. The parts of an argumentative
        essay are an introduction, the body, and a conclusion. Learn how to
        write a good introduction for an argumentative essay so you can get your
        paper off to a good start right away.
      </p>
      <p className="content-p">
        The introduction gives a brief overview of the topic, a different point
        of view, and a response to the other end of the view. Then say what your
        main point is. In the body paragraph, there should be one claim backed
        up by at least two pieces of evidence.

        Students get help writing argumentative essays for some reasons
      </h2>
      <p className="content-p">
        The things you have to do for school aren't just there to waste your
        time or make you mad. Argumentative essays are given to help you defend
        your ideas and decisions and see all sides of a controversial topic.
      </p>
      <p className="content-p">
        But writing the paper is more stressful than helpful when the deadline
        is close, you are too tired, or the topic needs to be easier to
        understand. Because they have to stay in the library all night to write
        their paper, many students have to give up their social lives, sleep,
        and even food.
      </p>
      <p className="content-p">
        Stress and being tired are also a reason. Getting an education can be
        challenging. You have to study, work on the side, take care of yourself,
        attend classes, write papers, and do other things. Between case studies,
        term papers, coursework, and homework, it's likely that you'll need help
        with an argumentative essay.
